# ChristmasTree

This is a 3D christmas tree, and it is made for a purpose of a [JLCPCB.com](https://jlcpcb.com/) christmas design competition. Even being a little of a overkill, the STM32F070F6P6 was used as the controll for the board. The WS2812Bmini LEDs are use to act as ornaments and lights. The power is supplied through the mini USB connector. There are two boards that are interlocking and they are secured by soldering the open pads on two boards, which also doubles as digital connection between these two boards. All components can be ordered directly from LCSC.com .
